# File Sharing and Management Platform

## Project Description

This project is a simple web application built with Go that allows users to upload, view, and manage files. Users can upload documents, images, and other file types, which are then displayed in a gallery format. The application includes form validation, static file serving, and template rendering.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of uploaded files with thumbnails and basic information.
- **Upload Page**: A form for users to upload files with validation (e.g., file type and size restrictions).
- **File Details Page**: Displays detailed information about the file, including a download link.
- **Static Files**: Efficiently serves CSS, JavaScript, and uploaded files (e.g., images).
- **Template Rendering**: Uses Go templates to render pages dynamically.
